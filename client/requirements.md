## Packages
react-markdown | For rendering blog post content
date-fns | For formatting dates nicely
framer-motion | For page transitions and animations
@tailwindcss/typography | For prose styling in markdown content (already installed but crucial)

API endpoints serve static file content via JSON responses
Images should be handled gracefully with fallbacks if featured images are missing
