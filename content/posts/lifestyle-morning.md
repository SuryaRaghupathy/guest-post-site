# Morning Routines for Productivity

How you start your morning often dictates how the rest of your day will go. Here are some effective habits to incorporate into your morning routine.

## Wake Up Early

Giving yourself extra time in the morning reduces stress and allows you to start the day with intention rather than rushing.

## Exercise

Even a quick 10-minute workout can boost your energy levels and mental clarity for the rest of the day.

## Planning

Take 5 minutes to review your goals for the day. Prioritize your tasks and visualize your success.
