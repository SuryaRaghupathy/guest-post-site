# Short-Term vs Long-Term Lets: Which Strategy Works Best in Today’s City Centres?

City centres across the UK have undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years. Changes in working patterns, rising tourism, housing demand, and evolving regulations have reshaped the rental landscape. For landlords and investors, one key question remains:

**Should you choose short-term lets or long-term lets in today’s city centres?**

Both strategies can be profitable, but the right choice depends on your goals, location, and appetite for involvement. If you are researching wider investment approaches, you may also find our guide on [buy-to-let investment strategies in the UK](/blog/buy-to-let-investment-strategies-uk) useful.

## Understanding Short-Term Lets in City Centres

Short-term lets usually involve renting a property for days or weeks, often catering to tourists, business travellers, and temporary residents. City centres naturally attract this audience due to proximity to transport links, offices, and entertainment hubs.

In popular urban locations, landlords often seek advice from professional letting agents to assess whether short-term demand justifies the operational effort.

### Benefits of Short-Term Lets

#### Higher income potential  
Short-term rentals can command premium nightly rates, particularly during peak travel seasons, festivals, or major city events. This income model is explored further in our article on [maximising rental yield in city-centre properties](/blog/maximising-rental-yield-city-centres).

#### Flexibility for landlords  
Properties can be used personally between bookings or switched to another rental strategy if market conditions change.

#### Strong city-centre appeal  
Visitors prioritise convenience, making centrally located properties highly desirable, especially near transport hubs and business districts.

### Challenges of Short-Term Lets

#### Management intensity  
Frequent tenant turnover means more time spent on cleaning, maintenance, and guest communication—often requiring professional [property management services](/blog/property-management-services-uk).

#### Regulatory pressures  
Many councils have introduced planning and licensing rules for short-term accommodation. You can read more about this in our guide to [UK short-term letting regulations](/blog/uk-short-term-letting-regulations).

#### Income fluctuations  
Occupancy levels can vary significantly throughout the year, affecting cash flow predictability.

## Understanding Long-Term Lets in City Centres

Long-term lets typically involve renting a property for six to twelve months or more, usually to professionals, couples, or students working and studying in urban areas.

This remains the most common approach for landlords working with experienced letting specialists across the UK.

### Benefits of Long-Term Lets

#### Stable rental income  
Monthly rent offers reliable cash flow and easier financial planning, making this option attractive for risk-averse investors.

#### Lower day-to-day involvement  
With fewer tenant changes, landlords benefit from reduced administrative and maintenance demands.

#### Clearer legal framework  
Long-term lettings follow well-established regulations, providing greater certainty for landlords. Our overview of [landlord responsibilities in the UK](/blog/landlord-responsibilities-uk) explains this in more detail.

### Challenges of Long-Term Lets

#### Lower maximum returns  
Rental income is capped by local affordability and market conditions.

#### Reduced flexibility  
Ending or changing a tenancy requires notice periods and formal legal processes.

#### Tenant risk  
Void periods or rent arrears can still affect returns without proper tenant vetting and ongoing management.

## How City-Centre Living Is Changing

Several factors are influencing rental strategies in today’s city centres:

### Remote & Hybrid Working  
While some renters are moving outward, demand remains strong for flexible, centrally located accommodation—especially for professionals on short-term contracts. See our analysis on [how remote work is shaping UK rental demand](/blog/remote-working-impact-on-uk-rentals).

### Rising Living Costs  
High city-centre rents push long-term tenants to suburban areas, but short-term visitors continue to value prime locations.

### Increased Regulation  
Local authorities are prioritising housing availability, making compliance essential—something many landlords navigate with the help of established letting specialists.

### Tourism Recovery  
UK city tourism has rebounded strongly, boosting short-term let demand in well-connected urban locations.

## Which Letting Strategy Works Best?

### Short-Term Lets May Suit You If:
- Your property is in a high-demand tourist or business district  
- You’re comfortable with variable income  
- Local council rules permit short-term letting  
- You can manage the property yourself or through professional agents  

### Long-Term Lets May Suit You If:
- You prefer predictable, steady income  
- You want minimal hands-on involvement  
- Your property appeals to professionals or students  
- You’re focused on long-term capital growth  

Many landlords working with [Belvoir letting agents](https://www.belvoir.co.uk/) choose long-term lets for their reliability, particularly in regulated city-centre markets.

## The Hybrid Option: Medium-Term Lets

An increasing number of landlords are opting for medium-term lets (1–6 months), targeting:

- Corporate relocations  
- Contractors and consultants  
- Remote workers  
- Postgraduate students  

This approach often delivers higher returns than traditional long-term lets, while avoiding many of the regulatory hurdles associated with short-term rentals. Learn more in our article on [medium-term lets in the UK rental market](/blog/medium-term-lets-uk).

## Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Strategy

There is no single “best” approach for city-centre landlords. Short-term lets offer higher earning potential but greater complexity, while long-term lets provide stability and simplicity.

Your decision should be based on:
- Property location  
- Local authority regulations  
- Personal involvement level  
- Long-term investment goals  

Speaking with experienced local letting professionals can help you assess your options and maximise returns while remaining compliant. For more insights, explore our full [Real Estate advice hub](/category/real-estate).
