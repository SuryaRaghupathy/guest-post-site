# The Future of AI in Web Development

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming the landscape of web development. From automated code generation to intelligent testing, AI tools are becoming indispensable for modern developers.

## Automated Coding

Tools like GitHub Copilot and Replit Ghostwriter are changing how we write code. They can suggest entire functions, write documentation, and even help debug complex issues.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

AI-driven testing tools can automatically generate test cases, identify visual regressions, and ensure that applications are robust across different devices and browsers.

## Conclusion

As AI technology continues to evolve, it will enable developers to build better, faster, and more secure web applications.
