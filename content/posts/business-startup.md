# Bootstrap Your Startup

Bootstrapping means starting and growing a business using your own resources. It's challenging but offers total control over your company's direction.

When you're bootstrapping, revenue is your lifeline. Focus on building a product that customers are willing to pay for from day one.

## Keep Costs Low

Be frugal with your spending. Use free tools, work from home, and only hire when absolutely necessary.

## iterate Quickly

Listen to your customers and adapt your product based on their feedback. Agility is your advantage over larger competitors.
